# AradhyaTech Library

Welcome to the AradhyaTech GitHub repository! This repository contains libraries that we deploy for public use. Here, you can find various open-source projects and libraries that are designed to simplify development.

## About This Repository

This repository will serve as a hub for the libraries that we develop and deploy. Our goal is to provide high-quality, reusable libraries that make development easier for developers. The first library we are deploying is the **ToastBadge** library, which allows easy customization of Toast messages with badges.
